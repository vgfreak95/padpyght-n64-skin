			-----INSTRUCTIONS-----
1. Download padpyte from the Github, if you do not have it the link is: https://github.com/lifning/padpyght/releases/tag/v0.0.2

2. Extract the n64byVGFreak95 file anywhere you would like.

3. Drag the file named "n64" into padpyght-win32\padpyght-bin\padpyght\skins

4. Boot padpyght and select your gamepad at the top and then click "n64" as your controller.

5. Press "remap" or "run" (if the remap button isn't there).

6. Watch the top of the window when you edit the buttons, I had to create clear buttons as this is a modification of the gamecube controller skin. When the C-Stick, R-Trigger, and L-Trigger show in the top left as your button to map, MASH the dpad.

7. Once you have mapped everything, Have Fun, and ENJOY!!!!!!
